# Hugging Face Audio Course

## Getting Started

Scripts used for data processing, model training and inference can be found in `./notebooks`. To setup a development environment for the notebooks first run:
```bash 
source ./setup.sh
``` 
This will install [CUDA Toolkit 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive) system-wide. 

Scripts have been tested in [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
