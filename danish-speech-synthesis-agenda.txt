optimize training
	- use peft
	- use torch.compile

optimize inference
	- use torch.compile for inference
	- use int8 mixed precision training 
	- remember to load vocoder to gpu
	- use optimum/ONNX runtime (ORT)

train model without speech enhancement and compare performance with the one with speech enhancement
	- if without enhancement model is better use it
	- remember rebase repo appropriately based on which model to select

train model with mcd for validation
	- compare with the two prior models and if this one is the best select it 
	- otherwise it may be that mcd metric is not appropriate and should be scrapped 
	- might need to train both with and without enhancement?
